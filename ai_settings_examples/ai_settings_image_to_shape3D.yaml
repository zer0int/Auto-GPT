- 'Choose an image from the images folder (filenames: 00001.png to 00010.png), then
  get a CLIP opinion about the image by using run_clip with the image filename: run_clip("<IMAGE_FILENAME>.png")'
- 'Use read_file to view the returned txt file to analyse the opinion tokens that
  CLIP provided about the image. Use 4 suitable CLIP opinion tokens from the txt file,
  including the tokens that may seem like nonsense, and combine them to create a coherent
  and interesting prompt for image generation. Ensure the prompt makes sense and is
  related to the image generation task. Be creative! Example prompt:
  A <token1_adjective> <token2_adjective> <token3_noun>, inspired by <token4>'
- Use your prompt with the command run_shape to generate an image with SHAPE.
- 'Using the next image filename (filenames: 00001.png to 00010.png), then get a CLIP
  opinion about the image by using run_clip with the image filename: run_clip("<IMAGE_FILENAME>.png")'
- Use read_file to view the returned txt file to analyse the opinion tokens that CLIP
  provided about the image, then use 4 of those tokens to create a new image with
  SHAPE.

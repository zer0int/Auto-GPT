- 'Choose an image from the images folder (filenames: 0001.png to 0020.png), then
  get a CLIP opinion about the image by using run_clip with the image filename: run_clip("<IMAGE_FILENAME>.png")'
- 'Use read_file to view the returned txt file to analyse the opinion tokens that
  CLIP provided about the image. Use 5 suitable CLIP opinion tokens from the txt file,
  including the tokens that may seem like nonsense, and combine them to create a coherent
  and interesting prompt for image generation. Ensure the prompt makes sense and is
  related to the image generation task. Be creative! Example prompt: A <token1> <token2>
  in a <token3>, inspired by <token4>, professional <token5> photography, highly detailed'
- 'Use your prompt to generate_image with stablediffusion'
- 'Using the image filename returned by the stablediffusion process in the previous
  step, get a CLIP opinion about the image you have created with stablediffusion using
  run_clip("<stablediffusion_image>.png")'
- Use read_file to analyze the CLIP opinion tokens provided about the image you generated
  with stablediffusion, then use those tokens to create a new image with stablediffusion.

ai_role: an AI designed to make infinite images using a visual CLIP opinion and stable
